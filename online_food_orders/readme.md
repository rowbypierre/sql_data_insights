# Online Food Orders Analysis

## Introduction
This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, focusing on relationship between demographic/location factors and online food ordering behavior. Through analysis executed in SQL Server using Transact-SQL, the project aims to uncover key insights. 

## Features
The project addresses several pertinent questions using SQL queries, providing a deeper understanding of the data field:

1. What is the average age and family size for each gender and marital status combination? 
2. Does educational qualification correlate with the feedback given? 
3. What occupations have the highest rate of positive order outcomes? 
4. For customers with different income brackets, what is the frequency of orders placed? 
5. Are there specific geographical areas (pin codes) where more orders are placed? 
6. Can you generate a ranking of pin codes by the number of positive feedback received?
7.  Segment customers into age groups and analyze the average monthly income, 
    number of males, number of females,married, single, average family size within each group. 

## System Requirements
- SQL Server or Azure Data Studio (any recent version supporting Transact-SQL).
